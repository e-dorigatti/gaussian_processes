This repository contains my own implementation of machine learning algorithms that stimulate my interest.
At the beginning of each notebook you will find a reference to the paper that describes the algorithm.
My goal is not to reproduce every singe table and figure in the paper, I am satisfied when I have enough evidence that my implementation is correct.
Sometimes the notebooks are not very refined because I try to limit the amount of time I work on a paper, because I lose interest, because I find something else that diverts my attention, etc.
